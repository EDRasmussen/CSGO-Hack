# CSGO Hack
External CSGO Hack for Windows 10.

Now that CS2 is out I felt that it was a great time to make this hack public so that others may learn the basic concepts of FPS hacking.

This hack remained undetected for the full life-time of CS:GO.

## Features
* Aimbot (human like mouse movement utilizing LERP)
* Wallhack
* Triggerbot
* External visual check (BSP parsing)
* Auto updating (pattern scanning)

## Todo
Currently we need a few features to make the cheat complete:

* Configuration, JSON.
* Netvar scanning (https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/counterstrike-global-offensive/129348-netvars-dumping-external.html)
* Hitbox triggerbot (https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/counterstrike-global-offensive/158860-external-hitbox-manager-dymanically.html)
* Set ViewAngles by moving the mouse, not writing to memory
* Calculate inaccuracy for triggerbot (and maybe aimbot)
* Parse models in BSP parsing (https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/counterstrike-global-offensive/170316-reversing-phy-files-collision-models-static-props.html)
* Mac OS support
* Linux support
